Diversity in Cornell Economics (DICE) was founded by a group of Cornell graduate students in the fall of 2019.

<br>
<br>

Our mission is to strive towards equity in economics and related fields, empower students to progress in the field, and provide a sense of belonging for all members of the economics community, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups.

<br>
<br>

We are currently working on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as building community among graduate students, in the Applied Economics and Management, Policy Analysis and Management, and Economics programs at Cornell. We are also working on outreach to Cornell undergraduates. In the economics profession more broadly, we are continuing to promote the diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts of other groups and individuals through our <a href="https://twitter.com/Cornell_DICE">Twitter (@Cornell_DICE)</a>.

<br>
<br>

If you're an undergraduate or graduate student at Cornell and you (1) are interested in or working toward a degree in Economics, Policy Analysis and Management, or Applied Economics and Management, (2) would like to get involved, and (3) are committed to advancing our mission, you are more than welcome to join us! Feel free to contact us at our email address above.
