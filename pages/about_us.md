  <h2>About Us </h2>
</div>
Diversity in Cornell Economics (DICE) was founded by a group of Cornell graduate students in the fall of 2019. We strive to improve equity in economics and related fields, empower students to progress in the field, and provide a sense of belonging for all members of the economics community, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups.
<br>
<br>

There are two types of DICE members: general members and executive board members. Executive board members are responsible for planning and implementing programming that furthers the mission of DICE.
<br/>
<br/>
We organize our work across several committees:
<ul>
<li> Women of Cornell Economics </li>
<li> Department Accountability </li>
<li> Undergraduate outreach and mentoring </li>
<li> Communications </li>
</ul>
